#### Learn Piano songs without using sheet music

## Why use this over sheet music?

Sheet music and the skill of reading music in general can be quite daunting, this project was designed to help eliminate the intimidation 
of sheet music and music theory by providing a simpler, more satisfying way of learning piano music. To achieve this, the tool would have 
to be easy to understand and navigate for the piano player. With the use of bright coloured lights that incorporate appropriate user 
feedback, an absolute beginner can use this tool to pick up a new piano piece and learn to play it within minutes. 

## How do I use this tool?

The process is simple, 
when a green light appears on the LED strip, the piano player must play the note that lines up accordingly. If an incorrect note is played,
the LEDs assigned to that specific note will light up red. When a correct note is played, the next note in the piece appears on the strip.

**You will need a digital piano keyboard, an LED Strip and the Arduino circuit in order to see the program in action**

## How/why was this created?

The Piano LED Learning Tool was created using an Arduino circuit along with code written in C++ as well as the Arduino IDE. This tool was
designed for beginners but can also be used by intermediate players as an alternative way of learning simple note patterns and scales. 
Using this tool will enhance muscle memory when playing the piano as there is less focus on reading sheet music and more emphasis on note
accuracy and correct fingering techniques. The objective of this system isnâ€™t to make the use of sheet music redundant, as reading music 
is still a very important part of music theory and is absolutely required for musicians wanting to advance beyond a beginner level. 
However, the project was created to serve as an alternative for beginner pianists who are just starting and would like to learn some basic 
songs/techniques. The tools purpose is to a serve as a less intimidating opening for people to express their interest in music.
